# VBA

Module 1: VBA


Overview of Project
	
	Module two consisted of helping Steve with a ticker analysis of 11 different companys listed on the stock exchange. 
Our primary goal was to generate an analysis of the performance for DQ which was a company that Steve's parents were interested in. 
The analysis drew in 3 data componenets for our review: (1) year, (2) total daily volume, and (3) return), it was our responsibility 
as the programmer to write code that allows the reviewer to determine a time period (year) and evaluate the volume of DQ and copmparitavely 
review its performance against the other businesses. To better help Steve and his parents, we included some conditional formatting to highlight 
and draw attention to those that have a positive return, as well as include buttons for easy data collections. For efficiency purpose, the code 
was revised to run at a fraction of the initial which has helped the analyst keep up to date with the data. 

Results

	In 2017 DQ's return was 199.45% and in 2018 DQ's rate of reutrn was (62.60%). Over the course of a year DQ's change in rate of return was (4.16) 
which indicates that the health of the company has been reduced. The data for DQ alone could not be an indicator of poor performance; however 
amongst the remaining 10 companies, DQ has has the work rate of return in 2018. Comparatively, the analysis shows us the weak performance that other 
competitors such as ENPH and RUN remain gren and are powering through the economic shift. 



Summary

1. Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Code:

Code refactoring is a method of extending code and making it more capable. 
 
 Advantages:

Extensible code - This functionality allows code to be more manageable for adding many other functions into it. In hindsight this increases the flexibility of the code. 

Maintanability - refactoring code allows the code to be mor elegible and minimizes confusion when additional parties open the code. The concept overall makes for easire maintainence.

  Disadvantages:

Timliness - refactoring is not the primary way to write code. There are shorter functions that will get you the same result, so writing a function in this manner can be more time consuming. 

More potential for mistakes - because you are extending the code there is a larger possibility for mistakes. This all feeds into the timeliness of it all because then it will take more time  to sift through the code to find any errors. 

Size - application size is a concern. It could be risky to incorporate a big program due to the greater chance of vulnerabulity. 



2. Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored VBA script:

  Advantages: 

Run time - the original code has the run time around 8-9 seconds. After refactoring the code, the program ran at 2- 3 seconds which reduced wait time. 

Organization - after refactoring the code each function was accurately accounted for and explicitly detailed. Additioanlly, the formatting is built 
into the code so it reduces the time fixing the document afterwards to make sure it is presentable. 


  Disadvantages:

System expectations - the system will defer to the code written before the exercise of refactoring code.
